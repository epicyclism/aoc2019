Advent Of Code 2019

Piecemeal transfer to CMake and github of solutions to Advent of Code 2019.

In case I forget...

mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/paul/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

(Path according to situation)

VSCode and Visual Studio ought to take care of this though.
